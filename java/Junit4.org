* Assertions
JUnit provides overloaded assertion methods for all primitive types and Objects
and arrays (of primitives or Objects).The parameter order is expected value
followed by actual value.Optionally the first parameter can be a String message
that is output on failure.There is a slightly different assertion, assertThat
that has parameters of the optional failure message, the actual value, and a
Matcher object.Note that expected and actual are reversed compared to the other
assert methods.
